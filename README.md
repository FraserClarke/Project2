### ≫ ──── ≪•◦ CODE FUNCTIONALITY ◦•≫ ──── ≪

- Application directs user to a login landing page with the option to create an account.

- Application successfully directs user to the account creation page when "Create account" is selected or user attempts login with an email (also the username) that doesn't already exist in the database.

- Upon clicking submit on account creation, information entered into the form will update the back-end database. User will automatically be directed either to the `Sales Dashboard` or `Storefront` depending on whether they have ticked the Business Owner ☑.

- Application allows user to log in if account has already been created and directs user to the `Sales Dashboard` (if the account type is a Business Owner) or the `Storefront` (if the account type is a Customer).

- When directed to the `Sales Dashboard`, a line graph displaying Sales Performance data for the week populates on the page via Highcharts.js as well as on the subsequent sales table.

- When `Inventory` is selected from the sidebar, user is directed to a page where user can add items into their inventory (_create to database_) and have it displayed in the lower section of the page (_read from database_).

- Items added to the `Inventory` will be editable (_update database_) & removable (_delete from database_).

- When directed to the `Storefront`, items will populate from database data added from `Inventory` & show each item displayed as dynamically generated cards.

- When a customer adds an item, the product will update in the cart within the sidebar and calculate the order total above the "Checkout" button.

- Once a customer selects "Place Order", the total from the sale will be stored to generate the Sales Performance data as a line graph for the Business Owner (_update database_).

- All files within application has been successfully required/associated in order to dynamically generate into .handlebars.

- Application has been successfully deployed to Heroku and can be visited [here](https://murmuring-bastion-13699.herokuapp.com/)!
